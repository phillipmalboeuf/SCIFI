# Lake-side
He had his right knee in the mud and his left foot firmly set on a felled branch. He scanned the lake's north bank. Fluorescent-green squares were drawn in irregular patterns above the water's surface. Breathing-in slowly, pulling with his right hand and lifting with his left, he raised a crossbow to his shoulder. He always enjoyed the weight of it. Breathing-out, he aimed a crosshair at one of the displayed bright squares. Feeling the bow's micro-servos adjusting its arrow-bank, he smiled; his latest tweak commits were doing work. His lungs emptied, he pressed the trigger. 

That {whipped} sound woke the forest. Ducks {quaked}, fish dispersed, frogs jumped-in, and a dog barked in the distance. A line following the arrow's trajectory was drawn in that familiar green, and a loud wood-crack got a few more barks out of that dog. Zooming-in and refilling his lungs, he saw a pair of wings painstakingly try to free themselves and a long neck slowly bend as the lake returned to its usual silence. With a sigh he pushed himself to his feet, strapped his bow to his back, and stretched his arms to the tree-line. His shoulders were not what they used to be. 

An aluminium canoe was waiting for him. Jumping in and sitting down with his usual non-grace, he picked up an oar and rowed on a long arch across the lake. Reaching the middle of it, he pulled the oar across his thighs and looked in the water. He remembered when he threw her overboard and the death-stare he got that day. He pulled a steel black keyboard from a pocket in his left forearm and typed-in: "To A: Tu m'manques". *I miss you.*

He slid the board back in, dropped his oar back in the water, and kept on paddling. As soon as he heard that familiar sound of sand scratching a canoe, he received a: "R: J'm'en fou compl√®tement :p". *I certainly don't care :P.* He grinned, a wide-as-his-face grin.
